# TimeLog

Log lock/unlock of your mac. This is handy for keeping (rough) track on how much 
time you spend on your computer. I use it to get a sense of how long days I spend
in the office. Naturally it can't cover when you're in meetings at the end or start
of the day and don't log in before/after, but it gives you some data at least :P
